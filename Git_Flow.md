## Here's a comprehensive guide to managing a feature branch workflow, including creating the branch, making changes, pushing to GitHub, and then using pull requests to merge into `develop` and subsequently into `main`. This guide ensures your branches remain synchronized and that changes flow through a structured review process.

### Step 1: Creating and Working on a Feature Branch

1. **Checkout to `develop` and Update**
   Ensure you're starting from the latest `develop` branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create and Switch to a New Feature Branch**
   Create a new branch for your feature from `develop`:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

### Step 2: Making Changes and Committing

1. **Make Your Changes**
   Work on your feature, editing existing files or adding new ones as required.

2. **Stage Your Changes**
   Add your changes to the staging area:

   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

   Or, to add specific files:

   ```sh
   git add <file1> <file2> ...
   ```

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   Commit your staged changes with a descriptive message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Implement my feature"
   ```

### Step 3: Pushing to GitHub

1. **Push the Feature Branch**
   Push your new feature branch to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin feature/my-feature
   ```

### Step 4: Creating a Pull Request on GitHub

1. **Navigate to Your GitHub Repository**
2. **Initiate Pull Request**
   - You'll likely see a prompt to create a pull request for your newly-pushed branch. If not, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request".
   - Select `develop` as the base branch, and `feature/my-feature` as the compare branch.
   - Fill in the pull request details: a title that summarizes the change, and a description with any relevant details.
   - Click "Create pull request".

### Step 5: Review, Merge into `develop`, and Delete the Feature Branch

1. **Review the Pull Request**
   - Have team members review the changes, run tests, and provide feedback.
2. **Merge the Pull Request**
   - Once approved, merge the pull request into `develop`.
   - GitHub offers the option to delete the feature branch post-merge; it's a good practice to do so to keep the repository clean.

### Step 6: Merging `develop` into `main`

1. **Create a Pull Request from `develop` to `main`**
   - This is similar to creating the feature branch pull request but select `main` as the base branch and `develop` as the compare branch.
   - Merge this pull request after review to deploy the changes to production.

### Step 7: Keeping `develop` and `main` Synchronized

- **After Merging to `main`**, ensure `develop` is updated with any changes from `main` to keep them synchronized and avoid any "ahead" or "behind" discrepancies:
  ```sh
  git checkout develop
  git pull origin main
  git push origin develop
  ```
- If required by your workflow, create a pull request for this merge as well.

### Documentation Notes

- **Pull Requests**: This workflow emphasizes the use of pull requests for all merges to ensure code review and maintain code quality.
- **Branch Synchronization**: Regularly synchronize `develop` with `main` after releases to keep them aligned.
- **Feature Branches**: Ensure feature branches are based off the latest `develop` to minimize merge conflicts.
